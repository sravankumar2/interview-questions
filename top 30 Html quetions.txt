Q1. What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?
 Elements:	
  The element is an individual component of the HTML web page or document. It represents semantics or meaning. For example, the title element represents the title of the document.
 Tags:
  It is the root of the HTML document which is used to specify that the document is HTML. For example, the Head tag is used to contain all the head element in the HTML file.

Q2. What are Attributes and how do you use them?
 Each tag has additional attributes that change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. For example, a <input> tag has a type attribute, which you can use to specify whether it’s a text field, checkbox, radio button or one of many more options.
 Attributes are specified directly after the name of the tag, inside the two angled brackets. They should only ever appear in opening tags or in self-closing tags. But, they can never be in closing tags.
  Example:
   1.<!-- Text field -->
   2.<input type="text" />
   3.<!-- Checkbox -->
   4.<input type="checkbox" />
   5.<!-- Radio button -->
   6.<input type="radio" value="on" />

Q3. What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?
 Block:	
  A block-level element is drawn as a block that stretches to fill the full width available to it i.e, the width of its container and will always start on a new line.
  Elements that are block-level by default: <div>, <img>, <section>, <form>, <nav>.
 Inline:	
  Inline elements are drawn where they are defined and only take up space that is absolutely needed. The easiest way to understand how they work is to look at how text flows on a page.
  Examples of elements that are inline by default: <span>, <b>, <strong>, <a>, <input>.

Q4. When are comments used in HTML?
 To understand the code easily, you can add code comments to your HTML document.

  For example:
   1.<!-- This is a comment! -->
   2.<!-- Comments can span multiple lines too -->
   3.<!-- This part is ignored in the browser -->
